# Seconds-And-Minutes
This program converts minutes and seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.

The first method takes minutes and seconds as parameters. The second method only takes seconds as a parameter and converts seconds
to minutes and seconds. It then calls the first method with the (int minutes, int seconds) signature to finish the conversion to hours, minutes, and seconds.
